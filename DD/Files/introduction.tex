\subsection{Purpose}
The purpose of this document is to describe in details the concepts expressed in the RASD file, and to specify how the system will be implemented and which logical and physical components will be used.

\subsection{Scope}
The system aims at providing a calendar application that automatically computes the travel times and the journey among the meetings of the user.
The architecture is divided in three layers so that it is extensible and easily maintainable.
The client act as a fat client and implements most of the logic of the system, whereas the server provides support functions.
Design patterns and architectural styles will be used to provide a reliable and maintainable system.

\subsection{Document Structure}
This document is structured in three parts:
\begin{itemize}
\item
Part 1: the first part focuses on the design and it is composed by four parts: Architectural, Algorithm and User Interface Design.\\
In the first part the document focuses on the physical and logical components, on how their are aggregated and on their functions.\\
In the algorithm part, the document analyzes two of the main algorithms of the system.\\
In the User Interface part, the document gives a more precise descrption of the UI components and explains how they are connected together.
\item
Part 2: in the second part the document focuses on the requirements of the system and specifies how they have been implemented and how they are connected to the components of the system.
\item
Part 3: in the third part the document focuses on the implementation, integration and test plan, explaining how the development team should proceed to test and implement the all the components.
\item
Part 4: in the fourth part the document focuses on the efforts spent to the writing of this documents and explains how the work was distributed among the components of the team.
\end{itemize}
